# Chess Project in C++

This project is a simple chess game developed in C++ and runnable in the terminal (CMD). With this project, two players can easily engage in a game of chess within the terminal environment.

## Features

- **Chess in the Terminal**: This project enables playing chess in a text-based environment.
- **Initial Implementation**: Currently, the chessboard and pieces have been implemented, along with the legal moves for each piece.
- **Future Enhancements**: The project is not yet complete and requires further development of algorithms to determine the end of the game, check and checkmate, and track the game's duration.

This project serves as a useful exercise in C++ programming and logical game design, allowing users to challenge their programming skills. 

If you're interested in contributing to the continuation of this project, we welcome collaboration with others!

## Libraries Used

This project does not utilize any specific libraries or game development frameworks; it is implemented solely using basic libraries.
